# üß† 100 Days of Python & Machine Learning Challenge

Welcome to my personal **100-day challenge** to master **Python programming** and **Machine Learning**, inspired by the [DSGuru](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dsguru) learning community.

This repository is organized into two structured phases to build foundational programming skills and apply them to real-world machine learning problems.
