# 📘 Week 1 – Python Fundamentals (Day 1–6)

Welcome to **Week 1** of the 100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge!  
This week focuses on the **basics of Python** — ideal for beginners and those refreshing their programming skills.

Each notebook in this folder includes explanations and hands-on code examples.

---

## 📅 Day-wise Breakdown with Notes

### ✅ Day 1 – What is Python?
- Overview of Python, print statements
- Comments and escape characters  
📝 *Python is easy to read and widely used in data science.*

---

### ✅ Day 2 – Keywords, Variables & Data Types
- Python keywords and rules for naming variables
- Data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`  
📝 *Everything in Python is an object.*

---

### ✅ Day 3 – User Input & Operators
- `input()` function
- Arithmetic, comparison, logical operators  
📝 *User input is always a string — convert it when needed!*

---

### ✅ Day 4 – Conditional Statements
- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- Nested and multiple conditions  
📝 *Conditions control decision-making in your program.*

---

### ✅ Day 5 – Loops (for, while, range)
- Repetition with `for` and `while`
- Using `range()` in loops  
📝 *Loops reduce code repetition and help in automation.*

---

### ✅ Day 6 – Lists & Tuples
- Creating and accessing lists and tuples
- List methods, immutability of tuples  
📝 *Lists are mutable, tuples are not. Use them wisely!*

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals for Week 1

- Write and understand basic Python programs
- Handle input/output and make decisions with conditions
- Use loops for repetition and collections to store data

---

## 🚀 What’s Next?

After this week, check out:
- [`Week_1_Mini_Project/`](../Week_1_Mini_Project/) – A small Python project to apply your learning
- `Week_2_Basic_Python_Advanced/` – Sets, dictionaries, functions, and file handling
